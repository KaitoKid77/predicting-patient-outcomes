# Predicting ICU Patient Mortality via ML

## Overview
The challenge is to create a model that uses data from the first 24 hours of intensive care to predict patient survival. MIT's GOSSIS community initiative, with privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe. This data is part of a growing global effort and consortium spanning Argentina, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, Brazil, and more than 200 hospitals in the United States.

## Where the Data is Coming From
Data is derived from [The WiDS Datathon 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2020/overview), which focuses on patient health through data from MITâ€™s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative. The competition was open until February 24, 2020 but the data in csv form is still accessible from the Kaggle site. The data dictionary for this project can be found indside the resources folder inside the project.
