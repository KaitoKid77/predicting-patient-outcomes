# Predicting ICU Patient Mortality via ML

## Where the Data is Coming From
Data is derived from [The WiDS Datathon 2020](https://www.kaggle.com/c/widsdatathon2020/overview), which focuses on patient health through data from MITâ€™s GOSSIS (Global Open Source Severity of Illness Score) initiative. The competition was open until February 24, 2020 but the data in csv form is still accessible from the Kaggle site. The data dictionary for this project can be found indside the resources folder inside the project.
